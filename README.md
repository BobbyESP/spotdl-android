<h4>A SpotDL python library Android wrapper built with Kotlin</h4>

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARN: PROJECT ALMOST FINISHED BUT NOT PUBLISHED IN JITPACK
By the moment the main library functionalities are done but they weren't tested. In a few days i think that it all will be finished and with the demo app made.
I'm going to make an Android Spotify songs downloader, so stay tuned! üòä

<h2>üî® HOW IT WORKS</h2>
</div>

## Installation

**In Gradle:**
- **Step 1:** Add the Jitpack repository to your build.gradle file at the project level.
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

- **Step 2:** Add the library dependence to your build.gradle file at app/module level.
```gradle
dependencies {
  implementation "com.github.bobbyesp.spotdl-android:library:$spotdllib_version"
}
```
>**Note**
You can add an `extra` property in Gradle for more organization/readability. In this example, as you can see, the property for putting the version of the library in the dependency declaration is called `spotdllib_version` and it should look like this:
```gradle
  allprojects{
    extras{
      spotdllib_version = '0.1.0'
    }
  }
```
Jitpack sometimes works quite bad, so if the library downloading fails, please, change the version value to `-SNAPSHOT`

**Things that are mandatory:**

- You need to put the property `android:extractNativeLibs="true"` in your app's AndroidManifest.xml because the spotdl binary is already included in the library and Android can't open it without this permission.

## Usage

>**Note**
Python 3.8 is already bundled in the library

 - **Step 1:**
 The first thing you have to do is to initialize the library. It's highly recommended to do it in the `onCreate` function in your MainActivity or Application class.
 
 ```kotlin
 try {
  SpotDL.getInstance().init(this@App) //Replace @App by the class you're using to initiate the lib.
 } catch (e: Excpetion) {
  Log.e("SpotDLExample", "An error ocurreed while trying to initiate the library: $e")
 }
 ```
 
 
## FFMpeg

For using FFMpeg, you have to add an additional library (or by the moment the only way. In next releases it **may** be included).

- You have to add to your dependecies declaration the next library:
```gradle
dependencies {
  implementation "com.github.yausername.youtubedl-android:ffmpeg:-SNAPSHOT"
}
```

See [youtubedl-android](https://github.com/yausername/youtubedl-android) library. Scroll down till the FFMpeg index in the README.

Now, you have to add this code to the last try-catch example:
```kotlin
FFMpeg.getInstance.init(this@App) //Same as before
```

Getting a final try-catch like this:
 ```kotlin
 try {
  SpotDL.getInstance().init(this@App) //Replace @App by the class you're using to initiate the lib.
  FFMpeg.getInstance.init(this@App)
 } catch (e: Excpetion) {
  Log.e("SpotDLExample", "An error ocurreed while trying to initiate the library: $e")
 }
 ```
